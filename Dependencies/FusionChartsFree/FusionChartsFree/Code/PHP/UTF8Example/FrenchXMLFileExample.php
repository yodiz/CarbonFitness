	In this example, we show how to use UTF characters in charts created with FusionCharts 
	Here, the XML data for the chart is present in Data/FrenchData.xml. 
	The xml file should be created and saved with an editor
	which places the UTF8 BOM. The first line of the xml should contain the
	xml declaration like this: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
